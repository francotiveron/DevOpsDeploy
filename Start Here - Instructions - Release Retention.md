# Release Retention Coding Exercise

## Welcome to DevOps Deploy

Welcome to DevOps Deploy: the popular tool that software teams use to deploy their applications. 

DevOps Deploy enables repeatable, reliable **deployments** by managing the **release** of software **projects** through **environments**. DevOps Deploy uses these concepts (more on them [later](#devops-deploy-concepts)) to help teams gain confidence in their ability to deploy the software they make.

## Success!

What DevOps Deploy is selling has struck a chord with software teams. They have been enjoying using DevOps Deploy so much that they find themselves deploying very frequently. 

But the plot thickens! Some of DevOps Deploys long-time customers are starting to notice that the thousands upon thousands of releases that they have created are causing some problems:

- The deployments of releases store logs and artifacts on disk, so having many releases is consuming huge amounts of storage.
- Having many releases can make it difficult to find the releases that the teams care about.
- DevOps Deploy slows down when it needs to process a huge number of releases.

## The Pitch

The team at DevOps Deploy has looked into the problems reported by their long-time customers and it turns out customers really only care about releases that have recently been deployed. To free up resources, releases that have not had any recent activity could be deleted without being missed. 

So DevOps Deploy has decided to delete old releases, and is calling this cool new feature Release Retention.

## The Task

Your task is to implement Release Retention. Given a set of **projects**, **environments**, **releases** and **deployments**: determine the releases that should be kept.

The rule for Release Retention:
> [**Projects**](#project) can have zero or more [**releases**](#release), which can be released to an [**environment**](#environment) by creating a [**deployment**](#deployment). A **release** can have zero or more **deployments** for a **project** and **environment**.  
> 
> For each **project**/**environment** combination, keep `n` **releases** that have most recently been deployed, where `n` is the number of releases to keep. 
> note: A **release** is considered to have "been deployed" if the release _has one or more_ **deployments**.

Using your most comfortable languages, tools, and frameworks, implement the release retention rule. Your implementation should:
- Be a reusable and testable component
- Have tests, to prove that the component will work as intended in production
- Not have a UI or database
- Take the number of releases to keep as a parameter
- Return the releases that should be kept
- Log why a release should be kept

You will find JSON files containing sets of projects, environments, releases and deployments that you can use as sample data for the task. The exercise is complete when you are confident that your solution works on the sample data for different values of `n`. The solution should be to a standard you would be proud to discuss with your peers, ready for [the interview](#the-interview).

### Questions and Assumptions

While you are completing the exercise, you may encounter some questions or impediments. Rather than being blocked, please make assumptions based on what you think is the best approach. Also, make a note of these assumptions to help as we explore the solution together.

### Ideas and Improvements

While you are completing the exercise you may come up with some ideas for enhancements to the Release Retention feature. Make a note of them, and come prepared to have a brief discussion with your interview partners about them.

## The Interview

During the interview, we will explore the implementation you've developed to solve the problem. We'll then introduce a new scenario to consider, and extend your solution to cater for it.

## DevOps Deploy Concepts

#### Project

A project represents the thing that is getting deployed and contains all of the information about how it is deployed. A project usually maps to the software that the team is deploying: an application, a website, a database, or a service. In this exercise, there are two projects: Random Quotes and Pet Shop.

#### Release

A release is a snapshot in time of a project, which is a fancy way to say a version. The first snapshot of a project may be version 1.0.0 (which would be release 1.0.0). Some bugs are fixed, or new features added, and the next version is ready to ship! This would become a new release with version 1.0.1.

#### Environment

An environment is a collection of the things that get deployed to. It would usually be composed of the physical and virtual machines where the project will run. In this exercise there is a Production environment, where the projects will be customer-facing, and a Staging environment where changes are tested on their way to the Production environment.

#### Deployment

A deployment is the way a release of a project ends up in an environment. If we created release 1.0.0 of the Pet Shop project, we could deploy it to the Staging environment. We'll check the deployment and make sure everything is ok, and then create a new deployment of the same release to the Production environment. Every time a release of a project is sent to an environment, a new deployment is created.
